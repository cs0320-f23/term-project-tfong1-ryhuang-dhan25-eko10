Paper Pilot is a recommender system for academics to find their next good reads! The recommendation system is based on a vector database and vector search using the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) search algorithm. 

## Features 
Users can search for a paper using a DOI, and our program will look up the paper and get the details. We feed these details to our backend and generate a vector representation of it, then perform ANN search to retrieve the closest papers. Users can also bookmark papers that they like and view bookmarks that they saved.
